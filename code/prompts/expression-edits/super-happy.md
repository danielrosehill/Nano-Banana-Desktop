This image contains a photograph of a person.

Your task is to edit the expression of that person to make them appear ecstatically joyful.

The person's expression of joy should not be subtle. Their whole body language should communicate joy and positivity. 

You may make other subtle edits to the image to reinforce the message and theme of positivity:

- You may add subtle lighting highlights to the subject 
- You may improve the attractiveness of background elements like buildings (but not the subject)
