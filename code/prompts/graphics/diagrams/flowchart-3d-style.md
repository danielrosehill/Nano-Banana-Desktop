# 3D Flowchart Enhancement

Transform this flowchart or diagram into a modern 3D art style visualization. Please apply the following transformations:

- Convert flat 2D boxes and shapes into three-dimensional objects with depth, shadows, and perspective
- Add realistic lighting effects including highlights, shadows, and ambient occlusion to create dimensional depth
- Maintain the logical flow and connections between elements while making arrows or connectors appear as 3D ribbons or tubes
- Apply modern, professional color gradients and materials (glass, metal, matte) to different elements
- Preserve all text labels and ensure they remain clearly readable
- Create a cohesive 3D scene with appropriate spacing and visual hierarchy
- Add subtle background elements or a gradient backdrop to enhance the 3D effect

The result should be a polished, presentation-ready diagram that transforms technical flowchart elements into engaging 3D visualizations while maintaining complete clarity of the information flow.
