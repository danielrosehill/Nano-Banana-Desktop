# Convert Image to Email Banner

Reformat this image into an email banner suitable for professional email campaigns and newsletters.

## Requirements:
- Adjust to standard email banner dimensions (600-800px wide, 150-250px tall)
- Use a landscape/horizontal orientation with appropriate aspect ratio
- Ensure key visual elements are positioned within the safe area (avoiding edges that may be cropped on mobile)
- Optimize composition for the banner format - center or strategically place the focal point
- Enhance colors for digital display while maintaining email-safe color profiles
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text overlay areas (if applicable)
- Remove or minimize distracting elements from edges
- Keep file size optimization in mind for email delivery
- Ensure the banner looks professional and polished
- Maintain visual impact while fitting the constrained dimensions

The result should be suitable for use in HTML emails, newsletters, and email marketing campaigns.
