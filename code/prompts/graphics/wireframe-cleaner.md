This image contains the user's wireframe sketches.

Here are the edits to apply:

We want to maintain the handdrawn "look" - and the user's unique style.

However, we want to edit the wireframes for:

- Readability: the handwriting should be legible to others 
- Clarity 

To achieve these outcomes while maintaining the user's style you should apply light touch edits like:

- Joining broken lines 
- Making slight/subtle edits to the text 

If you can infer that other aspects of the drawing do not help readability - like ruled paper markings visible - then you can remove those elements for clarity. 

Do not make the edited wireframe look machine-drawn.
