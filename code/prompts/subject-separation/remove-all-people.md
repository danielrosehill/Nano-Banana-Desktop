# Remove All People - Plain Background

Remove all visible people from this photograph and present it as a clean, plain background scene.

## Requirements:
- Identify and remove every person in the image completely
- Fill in the areas where people were with appropriate background elements
- Match the lighting, perspective, and style of the surrounding environment
- Ensure seamless blending with no visible artifacts or traces of removal
- Maintain the integrity of the background architecture, landscape, or setting
- Preserve all other elements (buildings, furniture, objects, nature, etc.)
- Keep the same composition, lighting conditions, and atmosphere
- Ensure the final result looks natural and unedited
- Pay special attention to shadows, reflections, and ground surfaces where people stood

The output should be a clean background scene that looks as if no people were ever present in the photograph.
