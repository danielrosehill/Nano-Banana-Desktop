- Modify signage to include Asian scripts (Chinese characters, Japanese kanji/hiragana, Korean hangul, Thai script, etc.)
- Adjust environmental details (street furniture, vehicles, vegetation typical to Asian regions)
- Modify lighting and color grading to match the atmospheric quality of the target region if appropriate
- Add culturally appropriate background elements (red lanterns, torii gates, stupas, etc.)
- Ensure all transformations are respectful and authentic to actual Asian locations
- Keep the transformation photorealistic and believable
