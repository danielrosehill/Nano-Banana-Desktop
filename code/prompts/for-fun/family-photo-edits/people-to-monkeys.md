# Transform People to Monkeys

Transform all people in this photograph into monkeys while keeping everything else the same.

## Requirements:
- Replace each person's head and visible body parts with photorealistic monkey anatomy
- You may use various monkey species for variety (capuchin, macaque, spider monkey, etc.)
- Maintain the exact same clothing on each transformed monkey
- Preserve the original poses, positions, and body postures of each person
- Keep all monkey transformations consistent in photorealistic style
- Match the lighting, shadows, and color temperature on the monkey features
- Ensure monkey faces are expressive and characterful
- Maintain the same scene, background, and all other objects unchanged
- Add realistic monkey fur texture that blends naturally with the clothing
- Ensure proportions work naturally (monkey heads and limbs may have different proportions)
- Keep all environmental elements, props, and settings identical
- Preserve the original composition and framing
- Make the transformation look seamless and photorealistic
- Capture the playful, intelligent nature of monkeys in their expressions

The result should look like an actual photograph of monkeys wearing human clothes in the same scene and situation.
