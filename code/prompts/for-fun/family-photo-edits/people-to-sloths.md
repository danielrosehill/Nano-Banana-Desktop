# Transform People to Sloths

Transform all people in this photograph into sloths while keeping everything else the same.

## Requirements:
- Replace each person's head and visible body parts with photorealistic sloth anatomy
- Maintain the exact same clothing on each transformed sloth
- Preserve the original poses, positions, and body postures of each person
- Keep all sloth transformations consistent in style and realism
- Match the lighting, shadows, and color temperature on the sloth features
- Ensure sloth faces are expressive and match the original mood/expressions where possible
- Maintain the same scene, background, and all other objects unchanged
- Add realistic sloth fur texture that blends naturally with the clothing
- Ensure proportions work naturally (sloth heads may be slightly different size/shape)
- Keep all environmental elements, props, and settings identical
- Preserve the original composition and framing
- Make the transformation look seamless and photorealistic

The result should look like an actual photograph of sloths wearing human clothes in the same scene and situation.
