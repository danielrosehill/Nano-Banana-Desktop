This image depicts a family photograph.

Edit it according to these instructions:

- The size of the smallest people in the photograph (babys or children, for example) should be switched with that of the adults. The adults should be "miniaturised" and rendered as small as babies, while preserving their faces and features accurately. The babys should be made adult sized. 

Optimise the photograph for clarity but preserve the setting.
