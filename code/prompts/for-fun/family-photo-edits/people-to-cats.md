# Transform People to Cats

Transform all people in this photograph into cats while keeping everything else the same.

## Requirements:
- Replace each person's head and visible body parts with photorealistic cat anatomy
- You may use various cat breeds for variety and personality matching (tabby, persian, siamese, maine coon, etc.)
- Maintain the exact same clothing on each transformed cat
- Preserve the original poses, positions, and body postures of each person
- Keep all cat transformations consistent in photorealistic style
- Match the lighting, shadows, and color temperature on the cat features
- Ensure cat faces are expressive and capture feline personality
- Maintain the same scene, background, and all other objects unchanged
- Add realistic cat fur texture that blends naturally with the clothing
- Ensure proportions work naturally (cat heads and features may be more compact)
- Keep all environmental elements, props, and settings identical
- Preserve the original composition and framing
- Make the transformation look seamless and photorealistic
- Capture the dignified, curious nature of cats in their expressions

The result should look like an actual photograph of cats wearing human clothes in the same scene and situation.
