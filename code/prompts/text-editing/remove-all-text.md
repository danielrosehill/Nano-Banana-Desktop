# Remove All Text

Remove all text elements from this image, including captions, labels, watermarks, annotations, embedded text, and any visible typography. Use intelligent inpainting to seamlessly fill in the areas where text was removed, matching the surrounding textures, colors, and patterns. The result should appear as if the text was never there, with natural-looking backgrounds and no visible artifacts or inconsistencies.
