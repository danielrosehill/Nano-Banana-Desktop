# Cartoon-Style Avatar

Transform this image into a fun, cartoon-style avatar with illustrated characteristics. Simplify the features into clean, stylized shapes while maintaining recognizable likeness, use bold colors and smooth shading, add expressive cartoon elements like enlarged eyes or simplified facial features, and create a playful, animated aesthetic. The result should look like a professional character illustration or digital cartoon portrait suitable for casual social media use.
