# Smart Text Replacement

Analyze this image to identify and differentiate between meaningful text and pseudotext. Please perform the following:

- Identify which text elements appear to be pseudotext, placeholder text, gibberish, or AI-generated nonsense characters
- Distinguish these from intentional, meaningful text that should be preserved (such as proper labels, captions, or readable words)
- Remove only the pseudotext elements using intelligent inpainting
- Preserve all legitimate, readable text exactly as it appears
- Seamlessly fill in areas where pseudotext was removed, matching surrounding textures, colors, and patterns
- Maintain the overall composition and visual balance of the image

The result should clean up meaningless or garbled text artifacts while keeping all intentional textual content intact and readable.
