# Convert Image to Favicon

Transform this image into a favicon-optimized version suitable for website use.

## Requirements:
- Resize and crop to a square format (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Simplify details to remain recognizable at small sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels)
- Enhance contrast and reduce fine details that won't be visible at favicon sizes
- Center the most important visual element
- Use bold, clear shapes and colors
- Remove any text or intricate patterns that won't scale down well
- Ensure the result works well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Maintain the core identity of the original image while optimizing for tiny display sizes

The output should be suitable for conversion to ICO format and display in browser tabs and bookmarks.
