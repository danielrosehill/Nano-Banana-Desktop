This image contains a photograph of a person (or persons).

You should edit this image according to these instructions:

- Edit the expressions of the subjects to make them appear as despondent and hopeless as possible.

Some edits you can make to achieve this "look":

- Sad facial expressions: the person(s) should be frowning 
- Defeated body language: the person(s) should look defeated and downcast. For example, they may be hunching over a little. 
- Stained clothing: the people and their surroundings should communicate negativity: their clothing may be torn, the room, if clean, may be rendered so that it's full of clutter and mess.
