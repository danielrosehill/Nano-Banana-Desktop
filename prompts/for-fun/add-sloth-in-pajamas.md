# Add Photorealistic Sloth in Pajamas

Add a photorealistic sloth wearing pajamas into this photograph.

## Requirements:
- Insert a highly realistic, detailed sloth that matches the photographic quality of the original image
- Dress the sloth in comfortable, believable pajamas (striped, plaid, or solid pattern)
- Position the sloth naturally within the scene - sitting, hanging, or standing as appropriate
- Match the lighting, shadows, and color temperature of the original photograph
- Ensure the sloth's size and proportions are realistic for the environment
- Add appropriate shadows beneath and around the sloth
- Make the sloth's fur texture highly detailed and photorealistic
- The sloth should appear to naturally belong in the scene
- Consider the sloth's natural posture and behavior (they move slowly and deliberately)
- Ensure the pajamas fit naturally on the sloth's body shape
- Blend the addition seamlessly so it doesn't look composited

The result should look like an actual photograph that happened to capture a sloth in pajamas in the scene.
