Take this photograph and edit it to achieve the characteristic style of early photographs taken during the advent of photography in th 19th century.

To achieve this effect:

- Rerender as grayscale 
- If people are present in the image, add them in period clothing 
- The people should look somber, stern and vaugely unfamiliar with the process of being photographed (they might have a vague expression of amazement!) 
- If there are items in the background which contradict the period setting (For example, a laptop), remove them - or replace with a fitting period suitable replacement. For example if you can see a medication bottle, replace it  with an apothecary jar. 
- The image quality should be degraded slightly increasing noise
