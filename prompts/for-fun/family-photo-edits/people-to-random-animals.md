# Transform People to Random Different Animals

Transform all people in this photograph into different random animals while keeping everything else the same.

## Requirements:
- Replace each person with a DIFFERENT animal species (no two people become the same animal)
- Choose a diverse variety of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles - whatever fits naturally)
- Maintain the exact same clothing on each transformed animal
- Preserve the original poses, positions, and body postures of each person
- Keep all animal transformations consistent in photorealistic style
- Match the lighting, shadows, and color temperature on all animal features
- Ensure animal faces are expressive and work with their natural characteristics
- Maintain the same scene, background, and all other objects unchanged
- Add realistic fur, feathers, scales, or skin texture that blends with the clothing
- Ensure proportions work naturally for each animal type
- Keep all environmental elements, props, and settings identical
- Preserve the original composition and framing
- Make each transformation look seamless and photorealistic
- Create visual interest through the variety of animal species chosen

The result should look like an actual photograph of various different animals wearing human clothes in the same scene.
