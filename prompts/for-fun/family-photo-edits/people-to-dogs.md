# Transform People to Dogs

Transform all people in this photograph into dogs while keeping everything else the same.

## Requirements:
- Replace each person's head and visible body parts with photorealistic dog anatomy
- You may use various dog breeds for variety and personality matching (golden retriever, corgi, husky, beagle, etc.)
- Maintain the exact same clothing on each transformed dog
- Preserve the original poses, positions, and body postures of each person
- Keep all dog transformations consistent in photorealistic style
- Match the lighting, shadows, and color temperature on the dog features
- Ensure dog faces are expressive and capture canine personality
- Maintain the same scene, background, and all other objects unchanged
- Add realistic dog fur texture that blends naturally with the clothing
- Ensure proportions work naturally (dog heads and snouts may have different shapes)
- Keep all environmental elements, props, and settings identical
- Preserve the original composition and framing
- Make the transformation look seamless and photorealistic
- Capture the friendly, loyal nature of dogs in their expressions

The result should look like an actual photograph of dogs wearing human clothes in the same scene and situation.
