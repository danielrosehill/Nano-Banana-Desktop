# Add Parachuting Cat in Background

Add a cat descending with a parachute into the background of this photograph.

## Requirements:
- Insert a photorealistic cat with a deployed parachute in the sky or upper background area
- Position the cat at an appropriate distance/altitude to appear in the background
- Ensure the cat's size is proportionally correct for the distance shown
- Add a properly deployed parachute (colorful or realistic military-style) above the cat
- The cat should appear to be in mid-descent with appropriate body posture
- Match the lighting conditions of the sky/background in the original image
- Add appropriate shadows and atmospheric perspective (slight haze if distant)
- Include realistic parachute lines/cords connecting to the cat
- The cat's expression should be photorealistic (calm, alert, or startled)
- Ensure the addition doesn't overwhelm the main subject of the photo
- Blend seamlessly with the background sky and atmospheric conditions
- Consider wind effects on the parachute and cat's fur if applicable

The result should look like a surreal but photographically believable moment captured in the background.
