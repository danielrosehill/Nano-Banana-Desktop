The purpose of this repository is to develop a desktop image editing utility for Linux.

The utility will use Google's "Nano Banana" model for image to image transformation (note: Nano Banana is Flash 2.5 Images). For API docs, see /docs. 

To use the app, the user will need to provide an API key. This should be stored persistently.

See: /dev-spec for the user's development spec, outlining the desired initial design and features.

## Best Practices 

Refer to up to date API docs before attempting an implementation of API features
